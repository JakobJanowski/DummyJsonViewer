## Lessons Learned
It's been a while since I've worked with the MVC framework so it was nice to get back into it. The majority of time spent on this project was with the front end side of 
ASP.Net as I comparatively have much less experience with it and I've been focusing on other front end frameworks recently mainly WPF. In particular passing data between
views via my controller was particularly challenging but we got there in the end.
